NAME
     libfake

SYNOPSIS
     LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/libfake.so.1 CMD [args ...]

DESCRIPTION
     Libfake overwrites system / library calls with fake ones.

     Current implemented functions:
          struct passwd *getpwuid(uid_t);

     Environment variables are used for supplying fake results.
     The fake getpwuid(3) uses LOGNAME, GID, GECOS, HOME, and SHELL,
     to initialize the passwd structure.

SEE ALSO
     getpwuid(3)

BUGS
     Only works with executables that use system ld.so facilities.
